## Contributing Code
Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the project [roadmap](Roadmap). Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

You will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement before submitting your pull request be it a feature or a bug fix. To complete the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.msopentech.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.msopentech.com/)), you will need to submit a request via the form and then electronically sign the Contributor License Agreement when you receive the email containing the link to the document. This needs to only be done once for any Microsoft Open Technologies OSS project.
