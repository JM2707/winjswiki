# Outline
The following in this document outlines our roadmap for WinJS project. The WinJS developers, working for Microsoft Open Technologies, will use this as a planning and framing document for WinJS, not an exact specification or check list of features to come. Our plans can change and we are flexible. We especially value your feedback and want you participate with us as we plan our upcoming releases.

WinJS is a set of JavaScript toolkits that allow developers to build applications using HTML/JS/CSS technology forged with one key principle: 
* Provide developers with a distinctive set UI controls with high polish and performance as well as fundamental support for touch, mouse, keyboard, and accessibility

The team will continue to use these guiding principles as we shape the vision for the WinJS project. You can find details about the history of the project [here](History).

# WinJS Roadmap
This section outlines the areas of investments for the next releases of WinJS. The team has been learning and iterating on our process methodology on how to run and release the WinJS project. We've moved to assigning work into concrete milestones with the goal to complete it during that milestone's timeline. Once we all feel good about the quality, feature sets, and improvements we will release a new version of WinJS.

## WinJS 3.0 – Cross Platform
The main theme is to get our fundamental code base in shape and ready to use in web scenarios. This includes but is not limited to the following:

### Base Infrastructure
Complete any necessary internal tool migrations to have WinJS working on web tools

### Desktop and Mobile Browser Support
Ensure that WinJS can run reliably in Desktop and Mobile Browsers. This includes both Single Page App (SPA) utilities and UI controls. Rationalize our UI controls and UX in the web context. Provide a graded matrix for Desktop and Mobile browsers.

### Modularization
Allow developers to load in components of WinJS, rather than having to include every component.

### Minification
Provide optimized minified versions of WinJS for web deployment.

For more details see our [blog post](http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2014/09/17/winjs-everywhere/) and [release repo](https://github.com/winjs/winjs/releases/tag/release%2F3.0.1)

## WinJS 4.0 – Universal Controls and Visual Refresh

The main theme  This includes but is not limited to the following:

### Universal Controls
UI controls that enable "universal" experiences that scale across input types and screen sizes. Enabling application experiences that can reach across Phone, PC, and Tablets with one version of WinJS.

### Control Updates
New controls ContentDialog, SplitView, AutoSuggestBox, and ToolBar as well as updates for existing controls such as Hub and Pivot.

### Interoperability - AngularJS Directives
WinJS UI controls can be consumed as AngularJS directives while WinJS still remains framework-independent. We will enable AngularJS developers to easily leverage WinJS controls in AngularJS applications.

### Visual Refresh
Leveraging the WinJS branding and styling capabilities, create a new visual look that reflects our own updated Windows design style.

## WinJS 4.1 – Polish

This is a minor release intended to coincide with the next major release of Windows. We will be doing the final UX polish of all controls as well as reacting to developer feedback for WinJS 4.0. We will strive to not make major API changes with this release so that apps tested using 4.0 can be easily upgraded.


# Feedback
We also appreciate and invite you to give feedback and ideas for future development. So please participate with us as we plan our upcoming releases.
